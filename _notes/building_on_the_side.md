title: Building on the side
---

It is hard to build on the side with a full-time job.

A full-time job consumes your mental energy. We, humans, have a limited amount of brain cycles per day. A draining full-time job (like my previous job) can consume it all before noon. Luckily, there are ways to replenish one’s mental battery. The best one for me has been physical exercise such as hot yoga or running. I found lifting weights to be even more draining. 

There’s another way a full-time job gets in the way of building on the side that’s rarely talked about. 

A full-time commitment rewards you for showing up and working on menial tasks (e.g. attend useless meetings). You feel a sense of motion that you mistake for progress. As a result, you end up working far fewer hours than you are capable of. For example, you work four “**intense”** hours at your full-time job and finish all your tasks. Instead of jumping into building, you’re tricked into rewarding yourself with a relaxing afternoon binging your favorite TV show. In reality, you made no progress on the thing you care about the most, your long-term goal. 

When I took a year-off to focus on working on my side projects, I worked far more hours than before. Not only the work was energizing, but there were no “fake” rewards apart from the work itself. The progress was directly dictated by the hours I put in.
