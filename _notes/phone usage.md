title: Phone usage
---

For the longest time (~ 5 years), I have struggled with phone usage. I dreaded that notification on Sunday that reminded me that I spent at least three to four hours per day on my phone. *"That's three days of the week on my phone. I could have done so much during that time"*, I told myself. 

The main culprits were Youtube, Reddit and ChatGPT. Instagram and Twitter were long gone as it was clear they were not adding any value directly to my life. The others, I couldn't get myself to delete them. *"I use them to look things up"*, I told myself. 

My mood was at the whim of Reddit. I noticed that every time I opened it, I felt worse off later. It could be a rant in r/sanfrancisco or a success story in r/indiehackers. 

My curiosity found its best companion, ChatGPT. Any question that pops in my head can now be answered fast, in a format I designed for fast comprehension.

Then, one day, I dropped my phone, and the charging port broke. Charging it became unreliable and tedious.

Naturally, my phone usage declined until the phone stopped working entirely. I delayed fixing it for a few days for the sake of experimentation. Few days turned into a week. A week turned into a month.

I made the following observations during the time I spent *phone-less*:
- The world around us is full of clues. Whether you're going somewhere or looking for something, if you're patient enough, you will get there. There are plenty of signs. Also, most people are willing to help *(unless you ask them for a ride)*. Navigating these clues can also be quite fun.[^1]
- I would constantly look things up when I'm outside (hint: Explain AI). For example, I could be walking in the Mission districit (SF) and notice that it was a little warmer than my neighborhood less than a mile away. I will then hurriedly look up *How does SF geography affects the climate of SF's different neighborhoods?*. As it turns out, I didn't need to know any of these things. 
- Friends adapt. I was originally worried that my friends would be mad at me for not being reachable in real-time. It was fine.

The most important observation however was that I didn't need my phone. I didn't need to listen to music when I'm in the gym. I didn't need to tend to anyone when I'm going out for a walk. I didn't need to listen to podcasts on the bus. The world was entertaining enough. 

Taking a small notepad with me when outside made a huge difference. On the one hand, it was practical to write directions, grocery lists, .. etc. On the other hand, I used it to jot down a lot of creative thoughts I had.

Phones today are **insatiable** entertainment devices. Every single app is competing for screen time. Our brains on phones are analogous to our brains on sugar, except it's much worse. Our guts tell us when they're full. And we've been taught over and over how bad sugar can be for our health. 

How did my *phone-less* journey end? A small car incident happened in Mountain View that reminded me the utility of the phone. I pulled out an old phone when I came back.

It's been 2.5 months now with a phone and I am happy to annouce that a lot of the habits haven't *yet* resurfaced. The phone spends most of its time dead or lost somewhere. One habit has come back however: working out with music. However, it feels more of a preference than a necessity. *"A compromise I am willing to make"*, I told myself.[^2]

[^1]: Navigating the city without a phone was not that challenging for me. I stopped using real-time directions long time ago as an attempt to learn the map of the city, and be more present when driving. 
[^2]: Here, the reader might wonder *"what did you achieve with all this extra time?"*. When I reflected back, I learned that phone usage was not taking away from my productive time directly. Instead, it consumed my mental bandwidth and my mood during recovery time, which subsequently affected my productive time. I felt more present and less inclined to [consume]. I call that a win.
