Consuming 100 calories (e.g. a brownie) is easier than burning 100 calories. Spending $100 is easier than making $100. Listening to music for an hour is easier than meditating for an hour.

The world today is designed such that consumption is significantly easier than production[^1]. It is the path of least resistance. One ought to be aware when they’re engaging in one vs the other. 

Consumption acts take as input our mental headspace and reward us immediately with happy chemicals (or numbing). Consumption is when you reach for your phone when you wake up. Consumption is playing that podcast as soon as you hop on the bus. Consumption is mindlessly spending time with your partner on the couch. 

Acts of production take as input willpower and mental energy. The reward is progress. They force us to be present. You know you’re about to engage in a productive act when you feel that little friction in the beginning. A production act is having a deep conversation with your partner. It is also attempting to answer that ambiguous problem at work, instead of tending to small bugs or features.

Consumption per se is not harmful. However, we ought to be aware of three harmful acts of consumption. 1. Unintentional consumption. 2. Excessive consumption. 3. Consumption disguised as production. The latter can be particularly dangerous because it gives us the illusion of progress.

For example, when I am struggling with some mental dilemma, I tend to gravitate towards reading other testimonials which results in these aha moments that last a few hours or days at best, only for the problem to creep back up. In this case, production is delving inwards. Another common example are household chores that can consume someone’s entire day, leaving little space for creative work. 

Without self-awareness or accountability, consumption can fully “consume” our life and mental bandwidth. 

Choose intentional consumption. 

[^1] I can’t fully say why that’s the case, but my guess is that consumption goods and services are competing for our attention, and hence were designed with the least friction possible.
